# ProdTool

Simple tool for an Unpossib.ly challenge. It's a prototype so it's buggy and the code could do with some work (and tests!).

Open in vs2015, build and run. Click File->Load and select the "TestRules.ini", this will show you a visual representation of the ini (or you can look in it directly, there are comment lines explaining each setting).

Once you hit launch it will start a background thread and update your cursor according to the rules in the ini.
